import { Badge } from '@site/src/components/Badge';

defuse (`dfs`) is a composable terminal platform for AI-assisted development. It orchestrates agents, captures searchable command history, and runs cross-model review loops inside Ghostty + tmux.

Features are tagged with their release status: <Badge status="stable">Stable</Badge> <Badge status="dev">In Development</Badge> <Badge status="planned">Planned</Badge>

## Quick Links

- **[Architecture](/docs/concepts/architecture)** — The eight-layer protocol-first stack
- **[Components](/docs/concepts/components)** — Tools and services that make up defuse
- **[Workflows](/docs/concepts/workflows)** — Common workflows and message flows
- **[CLI Reference](/docs/reference/cli)** — Complete `dfs` command reference
- **[Configuration](/docs/reference/config)** — `config.toml` reference

## Architecture Overview

defuse composes approximately 2M lines of existing tools — Ghostty, tmux, libSQL, pi-mono, jj, fzf, starship, and others — through protocol contracts. Custom glue totals around 5K lines. Every component is independently swappable: if a better terminal emulator ships tomorrow, only the adapter changes.

## Key Concepts

- **Protocol-first**: every layer boundary is a contract
- **Terminal-native**: built on existing terminal conventions
- **Composable**: best-in-class tools, thin glue
- **File-first**: Maildir messages, TOML config, Markdown kanban — all git-trackable
